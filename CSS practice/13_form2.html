<h1 text-align="center">Khashayar Sharifi to improve overall efficiency and Nusselt number for double pipe heat exchanger with help of helical wire inserts in the inner tube with various geometry of coils, simulated various Reynolds numbers and frictional coefficients arrangements for laminar flow conditions.<h1>
<h2><p>helically baffles used to provide enhanced heat transfer performance and high-pressure drop compared to thesimple double-pipe exchangers. when increases the tube length, it effects pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics.<h2></p>
<h3>whereas frictional factor also increased 3.5-8 times than plain tube. Here majorly pressure drop influenced by the increasing the obstruction of flow by wire-wrapped helical inserts. Mainly tube wall temperature reduced in the cause of minimum irreversibility rate and more heat transfer characterisation.</h3><hr><hr>
